# Car-Dealer-Simulation

## Project Description
Welcome to the Car Dealer Simulation project repository! This simulation aims to replicate the dynamics of a car dealership, providing a comprehensive platform for inventory management, profit maximization, and performance analysis. Here are the key objectives and features of the simulation:

Objectives:

Inventory Management:

Efficiently manage the inventory and showroom to meet the daily demand.
Strategically place orders to maintain a balance between demand and inventory levels.
Profit Maximization:

Calculate the net profit based on selling cars, holding expenses, and order costs.
Analyze the average net profit over the simulation period.
Performance Metrics:

Track and analyze metrics such as average ending units in the showroom and inventory.
Identify the number of days with shortage conditions.
Comparison with Theoretical Values:

Compare experimental average demand and lead time with theoretical values based on specified probabilities.
Additional Considerations:

The simulation starts with an initial inventory of 3 cars and a showroom with 4 cars.
Orders are placed with a quantity to fill both the inventory and showroom to their maximum limits.
Shortages occur when the demand exceeds the available inventory and showroom capacity.
Notes:

The code calculates and prints various metrics, including average ending units, the number of shortage days, average net profit, and theoretical vs. experimental averages for demand and lead time.
